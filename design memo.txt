My approach to pratice problems was using a linked list. I used this approach
since it is similar toa waitlist that will allow us to make diffent kinds of 
edits like inserts and deletions. 
My approach to timed challenge was using a list with recursion.I chose lists 
since the indexing was going to be nesseary to this problem. This one works by 
finding the largest element in each recursive. It then removes it and appends 
it to a sorted portion of the list that is returned by other recursive calls
Overall both problems were a challenge that allowed me to emphasize on different 
styles.
